## My process
I started remember how to install tailwind and the configuration that i need to workl with just vanilla js
Then build my HTML, then add the tailwind styles. Doing this help me to understant other thing that are necessary when working with tailwind, like the usage in the tailwind.config.js

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The usage of the tailwind.congi.js and some basic styles with tailwindcss
